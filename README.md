Our mission is to develop such system, in which students will not reject educa!on. Students willbe engaged in learning by interest-driven problem solving and hands-on ac!vi!es. We will focuson helping students develop the abili!es to iden!fy their strengths, set goals, make responsible decisions, boost academic achievement, and reduce an!-social behavior. We will work with schools, students, parents, and the Board of Educa!on, to accommodate all the needs of all the par!es involved. Our pla:orm will change the percep!on of our educa!on and the way it is viewed.
